The Digest::MD2 module allows you to use the RSA Data Security
Inc. MD2 Message Digest algorithm from within Perl programs.  The
algorithm takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces as
output a 128-bit "fingerprint" or "message digest" of the input.

The Digest::MD2 programming interface is identical to the interface
of Digest::MD5.  MD2 is described in RFC 1115.

You will need Perl version 5.004 or better to install this module.
